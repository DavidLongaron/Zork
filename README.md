# Zork

INTRO:
This is a test game to enter the master Advanced Programming for AAA Video Games of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.
The game has been designed and the code has been all written by David Longaron Lorente.
This game is a simple game of solving a couple of puzzle to arrive to the final room and talk with the person inside.

WALKTHROUGH:
To complete the game the user needs to:
1-Input "up", then "pick", then "up" again, this way you take the key a pass the door.
2-In the second room, input "right", then "pick", then "left", then "left", then "pick", then "up", then "up",here you drop the "Yellow Key", then "right", then "right", here you "pick" and then "put" and you put the "Purple Key" into the "Purple stone", 
 them input"down" and you will pass the door.
 3- In the final room just input "up" once and you will be talking with the man inside and complete the game.

KNOWN BUGS:
-When you have to input a number in the "drop" and "put" command, if you input something that is not a number the program is going to enter in a weird infinite loop. Couldn't find why it was behaving like that in the time I had.


ABOUT THE PROJECT:
 This project is actually my first C++ project, until now I worked basically with JavaScript and TypeScript, and even if I had spent almost 6 months studying C++ it was basically theory to understand the concepts that are different to the ones I'm used to.
 At first I wanted to make a game with proper story and secret lore, but I was spending too much time thinking on how to do it to make it interesting, and at the same time I was using a lot of time just coding  text for the user to read, which is fine in a normal game, but as this is a test of my c++ skills, I thought that it wasn't the most interesting thing to do, so it ended up being a simple project in terms of text, but with more focus on the different things you can do.
 Also at first I tried to follow the structure of the Zork project, but I realised that for what I wanted to do it didn't make much sense, and that it was limiting the way to work, so I decided to make my own class structure.

For me the most difficult thing was get used to the new syntax and the way C++ works, I spend more time debugging and finding out why things were not working than coding per se. Also with this time of projects a litle bit more creative, sometimes it's difficult to decide wich features make.

 Thank you very much to the people reading and correcting this project, and I hope you found it interesting!
